🏴‍☠Just About To Fall🏴‍☠🏳

Sleeping/ waking didn't differ
Everything that I saw all cipher!
preferred sleep to active mind
That was me, that was my kind!
Never in a blue moon or it be red
or it possessed other rare breed,
I would like to wake, break
That soothing dreams seemingly fake!
But when chance would come
I stray alone blind- folded
Surrounding was halo- hazy covered!
I would just feel that I was walking.
Dim glimmer of street light 
showed me no more way 
They mere show more hazy - fog!
That was just swallowing me.
I lost my feeling and loved 
to be lost in the devouring mouth of darkness, cold foggy weather–
A dark background, none by me, knowing where to go, why to walk,
I still walked along up and down.
Suddenly a cold hand at least shivered my whole body–
I stopped, raised myself, looked back,
when I never loved to look back still looked back–
The cold hand suddenly turned 
To a gentle touch that burned
my heart in that foggy coldness!
My all path gets cleared!!
All fogs get cleared!!
I found I was walking along 
the verge of a great depth
about to fall deep,deeper, even deepest!
I caught that hand raised my self and got back to the main road!!
