Mom's Love:

“Ah mom! My leg is aching severely!”
“ What happened! What's that!” asif kissing she would relieve that wound! Or with severe caring she would make me forget if there is any wound or not! We all gets all times disgusted about her caring severity nothing else! In this world in humankind physiology a very simple theory prevails all the time! That is selfless love can't be perceived! Why? Very simple reason! 
1) First of all that love is given by your very near one!
2) The love demands nothing and you have no objection about the love! Your all requirements are at once full filled by that love with out any demanding! 
For all the other loves you must have objection and demand! Hence you can perceive that there is actually love 🤣! 
Only when that love winding you all the time would be vanished away, only that time you would perceive that it's vanished! And would cry for that! But that is never going to comeback!🙆🏻‍♂!

Today you are lucky you can write or tell something to your mother with present tense! But someday when that would be past tense think about really I swear you feel then, not now! 
So, plz guys don't loose this time! Love your mom!
But there always be something that would try to fullfill that love of your mom! That is the love that you have to find! Only by logical reasoning! Be logical and understanding real selfless love start finding who is loving you selflessly! So, that she can fill up mom's place in future if to a little extent that is fine! Love your sister, daughter all! You must find real love! Thank you!

Happy mother's day!
