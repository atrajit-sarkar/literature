<div class="poem-verse">
Karmamandir!!

Human is servant of love!
There's a stump stuck into the karmamandir,
The strong rope, fastened there never breaks!
We are gazing circularly.

Time flows,
Greenery fades!

Still no means of getting out of that circle,
We understand that circle is the end of horizon!

Everywhere green creeper,
Roughness there in my circle!

Alash! Now time to depart, bro,
In the last moment eyes get teary so!

Old greenery pops up in memories,
Smiling aside, I think what a deceit that is!

Tear vapour fills my eyes fading my sight,
Gazing with opened eyes goes in vein!

That moment in dimmed light I looked feebly,
Some creepers tossing heads at the boundary of the circle!

They only try to say “we don't let you go!”
Smiling, I say plz bind me no more!

Since the arrival I'm bound, now I want leave.
Plz bind me no more, leave me bro!

Just telling these, I closed my eyes!
Where Roughness, where greenery!
Everything gravely dark, nothing more!
I'm just crying meaninglessly!
