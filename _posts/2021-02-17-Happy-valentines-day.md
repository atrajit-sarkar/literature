<div class="poem-verse">
Standing in a boulevard, suddenly I felt lonely air amid full of greenery! All there full of spirit, but mind was still vacant like sand strewn desert! No oasis there although by the downfall nere by there was a small brook! I felt thirsty! No way to get down! No way! Wind was lonely! All the greenery getting fade! But suddenly some touch of hand from back made me jerked! I was sparked in a while! All sands blew away showing hidden well in my mind! I was freed! But walking down I meanwhile came to the grassy land— where no greenery was! But I felt all was wet and all was full of spirit and sweetness of greenery! I would hold that hand forever! I would always walk with that support! My dear never bring that hand back from my shoulder! Always be with me forever! Happy valentines day my dear❤!
