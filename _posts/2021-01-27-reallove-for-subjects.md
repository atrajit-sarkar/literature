<div class="poem-verse">
In our childhood we deal with lot of subjects and don't make any difference between them! We read all of them! But as time passes we understand our preference differentiates between them! Sometimes willingly sometimes unwillingly! But right choice is also hard to make! But remember love from your mind and make choice from your heart without listening what others might say is always best and we'll working!! Keep faith in yourself and carry on! If you think after the choice “oh shit my past was better than that, My choice is a blunder” — don't worry carry on! Life is long! You must find what you love in the end! Don't lose hope! If you lose hope you must repent in the end for that! Your present love is best if you loved it form your heart! Try to understand that whether that is really from your heart; if so, don't worry! Keep faith! If you now find some uneasiness plz remember love can't exist without quarrel !! So, plz carry on don't loose hope! Think it as an adventure to seek your actual love though your present love! In the end of the journey this present love would bring you to your true love!
